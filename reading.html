                <h2>Week1</h2>
                <p>It is interesting that hand-coding and self-publishing in the current web environment can be seen as forms of resistance against the commercialized web landscape. They allow individuals to maintain control over their content, challenge dominant narratives, and express their unique perspectives.</p>

                <h2>Week2</h2>
                <p>I like how cyberfeminism challenges the portrayal of women in science fiction by critiquing and subverting traditional stereotypes and objectification. It aims to disrupt the dominant narratives that often depict women as passive objects or hypersexualized figures in sci-fi. </p>

                <p>The document discusses the development of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and its impact on computer technology. It explores the transition from the command-line interface to the GUI, highlighting the consolidation of various interfacing methods into a single screen, keyboard, and mouse. </p>

                <p>In the intro, the writer dives into this whole idea of surveillance capitalism and what it could mean for all of us down the line. They kinda juxtapose the sense of belonging and feeling out of place in this tech-driven era, pointing out the good, the bad, and the ugly of living in a world where everyone's connected 24/7. </p>
